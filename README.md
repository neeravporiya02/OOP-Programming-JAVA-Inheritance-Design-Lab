(Steps to Follow)
1. Unzip and open the file in Eclipse.
2. In the src folder comment the  **public void work()** method in <strong> Doctor.java, Nurse.java and Surgeon.java </strong>
3. Run the <strong> Hospital.java </strong> file <br>
	the expected output should be: <br>
  Vito 123 <br>
  Michael 234 Heart <br>
  Vincent 645 Brain Operating: true <br>
  Sonny 789 has 6 patients. <br>
  Vito works for the hospital. <br>
  Michael works for the hospital. <br>
  Vincent works for the hospital. <br>
  Sonny works for the hospital. <br>
4. Stop the code and uncomment the work() method in the three files i.e. Doctor.java, Nurse.java and Surgeon.java
5. Run the application again
6. Now since we have done an Override on the work() method, the output will be: <br>
	Vito 123 <br>
	Michael 234 Heart <br>
	Vincent 645 Brain Operating: true <br>
	Sonny 789 has 6 patients. <br>
	Vito works for the hospital. <br>
	Michael works for the hospital. Michael is a(n) Heart doctor. <br>
	Vincent works for the hospital. Vincent is operating now. <br>
	Sonny works for the hospital. Sonny is a nurse with 6 patients <br>
